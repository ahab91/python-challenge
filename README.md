## PyBank
This folder contains a "Resources" folder which holds a CSV file which serves as the source data for this project. The Python file analyzes the raw data and synthesizes it into digestible findings which are printed to a text file located in the "Analysis" folder. These findings include the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period (as well as the average of those changes, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

## PyPoll
This folder is structured similarly to the PyBank folder but instead analyzes an election dataset. This Python script summarizes the total number of votes cast in the election, a breakdown of the number and percentage of votes by candidate, as well as the winner and also outputs the results into a text file under the "Analysis" folder.
